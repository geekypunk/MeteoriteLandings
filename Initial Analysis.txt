Possible reports

1) Areas most prone to meteorites
2) Patterns over time period. What time periods have seen an increased hits/decreased hits
3) Data is skewed towards areas of high population density..probably because they are easily found there
4) Himalayas as shield? low in the north-east of it 
5) High meteorites in Oman..why?
6)It is also noticeable that in countries with an ancient history, fewer are found near to where there are more people, 
for example there are fewer near the Nile valley in Egypt but apparently more to the west in the desert.
 I would suspect that means ancient people do collect them, and most of them are lost, 
which may explain why there are fewer found in Iran and Iraq? I would assume these are mostly modern finds?
